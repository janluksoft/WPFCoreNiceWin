# Nice WPF windows .NET5 Core

Nice WPF windows with dynamic themes changing.
In this project, I wrote classes to create nice WPF windows in .NET5 (extension to .NET Core). Standard windows in WIN10 are poor, primitive. For example, sometimes the title bar and the window frame do not stand out from the background, an impression of chaos appears on the screen. 
My windows have 3D elements, double frames, 3D buttons and other graphic elements. Many 'Styles' and dynamic events are defined in WPF. This makes it possible to reload the Light and Dark styles on the fly.

In future versions I will try to provide a mechanism for adding more user Themes.
